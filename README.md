This repository contains a collection of cryptography projects, each designed to explore and implement different cryptographic techniques. Below is an overview of the projects along with brief descriptions.

## Projects

### 1. Simple Shift Substitution and Columnar Transposition Decryption

- **Directory:** `shift-columnar-transposition`
- **Description:** Decrypts a message encoded with a combination of simple shift substitution and columnar transposition. The project includes a C++ program (`caesar_cipher.cpp`) for simple shift substitution and details the process of decrypting the original message.

### 2. [Add Another Cryptography Project Title]

- **Directory:** `[project-directory-name]`
