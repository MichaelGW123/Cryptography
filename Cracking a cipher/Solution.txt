I started working on cracking the simple shift substitution first. The program "Decrypting.cpp" is to help me find which shift is most likely to be the shift I should work with. 
Originally, I planned to print out all 26 variations of the possible shift, shift of 0 where the string remains the same, all the way through to a shift of 25 where A is Z, B is A, etc. However, given the knowledge that the original message was in English, I researched the frequency of letters. There are certain letters in English which appear more frequently, and other letters that appear very rarely. As I applied the shift, I kept count of the 5 most commonly occurring letters and the 4 least commonly occurring letters. The resulting shifts with twice the number of most common than the number of least common were the ones I printed out. This cut down the 26 resulting shifts to a much more manageable 6. There was a possibility that my cut off was too close, and that the substitution I wanted wasn't in those resulting 6. However, I got lucky and the first of the 6 turned out to be the shift that had been applied.
I used the website https://www.dcode.fr/columnar-transposition-cipher to apply the columnar transposition and found the key to be 7. Then I just had to find a way to organize the first column in a way that spelled words in English, and I had to original message.
